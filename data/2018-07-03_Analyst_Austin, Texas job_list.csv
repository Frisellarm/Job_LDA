The firm has executed a variety of deals, including domestic and international public company take privates, carve-outs, management buyouts, follow-on acquisitions, divestitures, re-financings, and sell-side exits. The analyst program combines the M&A aspects of investment banking and will provide a taste of the operational focus of a consulting firm, while approaching both from the perspective of a principal investor. Analysts are responsible for supporting the due diligence and research efforts of a deal team and will work with other investment professionals (including senior team members) and portfolio company executives (CEOs, COOs, etc.) to employ Vista’s unique investment and operating model to drive industry-leading returns.

Portfolio Management and Operations – Analysts will work with deal teams to help manage portfolio company reporting, oversight, and operations in conjunction with Vista’s operating and consulting arms (Vista Consulting Group) and will also have occasional opportunities to work directly with management teams to help implement industry best practices in a variety of areas (examples include organizational structure, employee compensation, financial reporting, sales execution, and product road mapping).
